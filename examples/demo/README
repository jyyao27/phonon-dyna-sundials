This folder contains a demo for running the code. 
The example uses a small k- and q-grid size for demonstration purposes. The results are not converged.

Please download and unzip the si_epr.h5 file and move it to this directory.


First run setup.in
perturbo.x -i setup.in > setup.out

Then run cdyna.in to obtain si_cdyna.h5 for electron and phonon populations 
perturbo.x -i cdyna.in > cdyna.out

Run pp.in to obtain si_popu.h5 for hole populations as a function of energy
perturbo.x -i pp_hole.in > pp_hole.out
Rename si_popu.h5 to si_popu_hole.h5

Finally run pp.in to obtain si_popu.h5 for electron populations as a function of energy
perturbo.x -i pp_elec.in > pp_elec.out

The reference outputs are in the Reference folder in this directory.

The typical run time should be about 20 hours on a typical 16G memory laptop.

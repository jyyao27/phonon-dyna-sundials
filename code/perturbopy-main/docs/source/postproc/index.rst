Postprocessing
==============

In the Perturbopy postprocessing module, we provide tools to help process the output of Perturbo calculations. The module allows users to export data to Python, perform calculations, and visualize data.

A Perturbo calculation must always be run before the results can be processed in Perturbopy. Please see the `Perturbo website <https://perturbo-code.github.io/mydoc_running_perturbo.html>`_ for information on running Perturbo. 

Please refer to the tutorials for information on running Perturbopy.
